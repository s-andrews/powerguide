PowerGuide
==========

A web based system for guided power analysis.

Power analysis is a crucial component of experimental design.  Many groups struggle
with doing an effective power analysis because of a lack of knowledge of the field 
or from not knowing which questions to ask about their own data.

PowerGuide provides a guided system for people to work out an effective power analysis
for their data.  It works by asking a series of guided questions to establish the
type and nature of the data and produces a comprehensive report on the options for
sample sizes within the experiment.
